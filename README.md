## Course Content:
 
In the last decade, genomic data analysis has grown from a specialized skill to a standard laboratory technique that is in demand across disciplines. We will learn how to design and analyze experiments that use high-throughput DNA sequencing, which can range from differential gene expression analysis to genome-wide association studies. The course will build on molecular biology content from BIOL 321 or BIOL 323 as well as statistical computing content from BIOL 340 to develop integrated skills in bioinformatics and computational data science. We will explore topics of specific interest in final projects with the goal of experiencing genuine inquiry-based learning.
